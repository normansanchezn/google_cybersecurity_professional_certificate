The CSF is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. This framework is widely respected and essential for maintaining security regardless of the organization you work for. The CSF consists of five important core functions, identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover, which we'll discuss in detail in a future video. For now, we'll focus on how the CSF benefits organizations and how it can be used to protect against threats, risks, and vulnerabilities by providing a workplace example.

Imagine that one morning you receive a high-risk notification that a workstation has been compromised. You **identify** the workstation, and discover that there's an unknown device plugged into it. You block the unknown device remotely to stop any potential threat and **protect** the organization. Then you remove the infected workstation to prevent the spread of the damage and use tools to **detect** any additional threat actor behavior and identify the unknown device. You **respond** by investigating the incident to determine who used the unknown device, how the threat occurred, what was affected, and where the attack originated.

In this case, you discover that an employee was charging their infected phone using a USB port on their work laptop. Finally, you do your best to **recover** any files or data that were affected and correct any damage the threat caused to the workstation itself.

The first core function is identify, which is related to the management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organization's people and assets. For example, as a security analyst, you may be asked to monitor systems and devices in your organization's internal network to identify potential security issues.

The second core function is protect, which is the strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.

The third core function is detect, which means identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. For example, as an analyst, you might be asked to review a new security tool's setup to make sure it's flagging low, medium, or high risk, and then alerting the security team about any potential threats or incidents. 

The fourth function is respond, which means making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process.

The fifth core function is recover, which is the process of returning affected systems back to normal operation.
