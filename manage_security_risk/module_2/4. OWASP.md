The main reason for limiting access to organizational information and resources is to reduce the amount of damage a security breach could cause.

### Security principles
In the workplace, security principles are embedded in your daily tasks. Whether you are analyzing logs, monitoring a security information and event management (SIEM) dashboard, or using a vulnerability scanner, you will use these principles in some way. 

- **Minimize attack surface area**: Attack surface refers to all the potential vulnerabilities a threat actor could exploit.

- **Principle of least privilege**: Users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks.

- **Defense in depth**: Organizations should have varying security controls that mitigate risks and threats.

- **Separation of duties**: Critical actions should rely on multiple people, each of whom follow the principle of least privilege. 

- **Keep security simple**: Avoid unnecessarily complicated solutions. Complexity makes security difficult. 

- **Fix security issues correctly**: When security incidents occur, identify the root cause, contain the impact, identify vulnerabilities, and conduct tests to ensure that remediation is successful.

### Additional OWASP security principles
**Establish secure defaults**
This principle means that the optimal security state of an application is also its default state for users; it should take extra work to make the application insecure. 

 **Fail securely**
Fail securely means that when a control fails or stops, it should do so by defaulting to its most secure option. For example, when a firewall fails it should simply close all connections and block all new ones, rather than start accepting everything.

**Don’t trust services**
Many organizations work with third-party partners. These outside partners often have different security policies than the organization does. And the organization shouldn’t explicitly trust that their partners’ systems are secure. For example, if a third-party vendor tracks reward points for airline customers, the airline should ensure that the balance is accurate before sharing that information with their customers.

**Avoid security by obscurity**
The security of key systems should not rely on keeping details hidden. Consider the following example from OWASP (2016):

	The security of an application should not rely on keeping the source code secret. Its security should rely upon many other factors, including reasonable password policies, defense in depth, business transaction limits, solid network architecture, and fraud and audit controls.

## Security Audit
A security audit is a review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations.

- An internal security audit is typically conducted by a team of people that might include an organization's compliance officer, security manager, and other security team members. Internal security audits are used to help improve an organization's security posture and help organizations avoid fines from governing agencies due to a lack of compliance. Internal security audits help security teams identify organizational risk, assess controls, and correct compliance issues. These include establishing the scope and goals of the audit, conducting a risk assessment of the organization's assets, completing a controls assessment, assessing compliance, and communicating results to stakeholders.
	- Scope refers to the specific criteria of an internal security audit. Scope requires organizations to identify people, assets, policies, procedures, and technologies that might impact an organization's security posture.
	- Goals are an outline of the organization's security objectives, or what they want to achieve in order to improve their security posture.

### Security audits
A security audit is a review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations. Audits are independent reviews that evaluate whether an organization is meeting internal and external criteria. 
- Internal criteria include outlined policies, procedures, and best practices. 
- External criteria include regulatory compliance, laws, and federal regulations. 

Additionally, a security audit can be used to assess an organization's established security controls. Audits help ensure that security checks are made to identify threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. This helps maintain an organization’s security posture. And, if there are security issues, a remediation process must be in place.

### Goals and objectives of an audit
The goal of an audit is to ensure an organization's information technology (IT) practices are meeting industry and organizational standards. The objective is to identify and address areas of remediation and growth. Audits provide direction and clarity by identifying what the current failures are and developing a plan to correct them. 

Security audits must be performed to safeguard data and avoid penalties and fines from governmental agencies. The frequency of audits is dependent on local laws and federal compliance regulations.

### The role of frameworks and controls in audits
Along with compliance, it’s important to mention the role of frameworks and controls in security audits. Frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and the international standard for information security (ISO 27000) series are designed to help organizations prepare for regulatory compliance security audits. By adhering to these and other relevant frameworks, organizations can save time when conducting external and internal audits. Additionally, frameworks, when used alongside controls, can support organizations’ ability to align with regulatory compliance requirements and standards.  

### Audit checklist
It’s necessary to create an audit checklist before conducting an audit. A checklist is generally made up of the following areas of focus:

**Identify the scope of the audit**

- The audit should:
	- List assets that will be assessed (e.g., firewalls are configured correctly, PII is secure, physical assets are locked, etc.) 
	- Note how the audit will help the organization achieve its desired goals
	- Indicate how often an audit should be performed
	- Include an evaluation of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to make sure they are working as intended and being implemented by employees

**Complete a risk assessment**

- A risk assessment is used to evaluate identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards (i.e., regulations).

**Conduct the audit**

- When conducting an internal audit, you will assess the security of the identified assets listed in the audit scope.

**Create a mitigation plan**

- A mitigation plan is a strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that can negatively affect the organization’s security posture. 

**Communicate results to stakeholders**

- The end result of this process is providing a detailed report of findings, suggested improvements needed to lower the organization's level of risk, and compliance regulations and standards the organization needs to adhere to.
